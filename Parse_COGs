The eggNOG mapper results in one file with the extesion ".annotations" by each genome protein dataset blasted against the eggNOG database. The script "parse_COGS.sh" must be placed in the same dir containing the script "extract_COGs_v2.sh" ( original name: extract_COG_local_v2.0.sh created by https://github.com/raymondkiu/eggnog-mapper_COGextraction) and "merge.py". Initially, the script rename the files (that obey the synthax: GCF_"numberXXX"_Acinetobacter_species) and then through several loops and the external scripts it builds a count table containing all COG categories summarized by each strain or species under study.
